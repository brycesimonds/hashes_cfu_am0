## Self Evaluation

#- What did you struggle with in this section?
In hashes_1, the "Write code that prints the value of the second food of the foods variable" I found myself
wanting to try new things. I wanted to find a way to use the index position to get the result, but through googling couldn't find it.

#- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
It is going well I think so far. It has been awhile since I have taken notes, so finding ways to not write everything down
and still get the important stuff is a challenge. I am finding taking the time to actually hand write my notes to be helpful.
I find myself taking the most helpful notes during the self-learning/reading times.
#- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Definitely trying to solve it myself. I do not mind making errors that I know how to fix. If I am worried
I will break the whole code, then at that time I bring the code over to a repl.it or something. That
way I don't mess up my terminal or git :)
